# Inheritance-in-JavaScript
Lets discuss abit about inheritance in ES6,what it entails and its importance

Inheritance refers to an object's ability to access methods and other properties from another object.

Objects can inherit from other objects and it works through prototypes.

In ES6 inheritance is allowed from one class to another,and that class can add more features of its own.
one class can be like a parent class while the other becomes the child class.

We will be discussing more about 'super' and 'extends'

The 'extends' is used to inherit from another class and the 'super' keyword is used to call the parent class which has the features.

The 'extends' keyword is used to create a child class of another class ie the parent.The child will inherit/get all the methods fro the parent class.

This help in code reusability and avoids duplication


The 'super' keyword is used to call methods of the parent class It is used within a cinstructor function to call the parent constructor function
